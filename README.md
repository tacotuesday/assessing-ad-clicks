## Installation

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`
- `statsmodels`

You can install these packages using pip:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels
```

## Project Motivation

The stakeholder wants to optimize online advertisements by identifying the most effective text color. The specific questions addressed are:
1. Does blue have the highest click-through rate?
2. If not, which color does?
3. Are the differences in click-through rates statistically significant?

## File Descriptions

- `assessing_ad_clicks.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the primary analysis
- `ad_click_table.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis (not included in repo)

## Results

Key findings from the analysis include:

1. Blue does not have the highest click-through rate.
2. Ultramarine has the highest click-through rate, followed by Sapphire, Aquamarine, and Teal.
3. The difference in click-through rates between Ultramarine and Blue is statistically significant.
